            </div>
            <p class="mb-4">Space weather events, such as solar flares and cosmic rays, can have indirect effects on vegetation health. Understanding these impacts can help in proactive vegetation management:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                <li><span class="text-indigo-700 font-medium">Correlate NDVI Changes:</span> Research has shown that space weather events, particularly solar flares and cosmic rays, can impact Earth's climate and vegetation. For example, a study by NASA found correlations between solar activity and climatic changes that can affect vegetation health. A dataset from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) can be correlated with NDVI data from satellite imagery. NDVI data can be obtained from sources like NASA's Earth Data or Google Earth Engine.</li>
                <li><span class="text-indigo-700 font-medium">Monitor Space Weather:</span> You can use space weather monitoring tools like the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center for real-time space weather data. They provide information on solar flares, geomagnetic storms, and cosmic ray flux.</li>
                <li><span class="text-indigo-700 font-medium">Assess Radiation Impact:</span> Cosmic rays have been studied for their impact on biological systems. For example, a paper titled "Effects of Cosmic Radiation on Plant Growth" by Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate discusses how high-energy cosmic rays can alter plant growth and development.</li>
                <li><span  class="text-indigo-700 font-medium">Adjust Agricultural Practices:</span> Research articles like "Agricultural Adaptation to Space Weather Events" in journals such as Agricultural Systems provide recommendations on modifying agricultural practices based on space weather forecasts.</li>
                <li><span class="text-indigo-700 font-medium">Collaborate with Experts:</span> Collaborations can be established with institutions like the European Space Agency (ESA), which conducts research on space weather impacts on Earth.</li>
